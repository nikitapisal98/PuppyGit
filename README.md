## Editor
Due to PuppyGit's Editor very basic and I have no plan to implement a complex editor for now. so I recommend some editors I was tried:

`Squircle CE` code editor: https://github.com/massivemadness/Squircle-CE
    
`Markor`, markdown editor: https://github.com/gsantner/markor

After installed, you can use PuppyGit's "Open As" feature to launch them in PuppyGit.


## About ssh
when first time connect to an unknown host, PuppyGit will ask you allow/reject as default, its more safety, also, if you want, you can allow unknown hosts by default, just checkout the Settings page.
#### note: PuppyGit only require private key and passphrase for connect to remote repo by ssh, it doesn't support generate ssh keys, if you want to generate ssh keys on android, try another app of mine: <a href=https://github.com/catpuppyapp/PuppySshKeyMan/releases>Ssh Key Man</a>

## About signing commit/tag
see: https://github.com/catpuppyapp/PuppyGit/issues/4

## About PC version
see: https://github.com/catpuppyapp/PuppyGit/issues/11


## Build
import project to Android Studio, then build, that's all. (android NDK is required)
<br><br>
### if you want to build libs by your self
The <a href=https://github.com/catpuppyapp/PuppyGit/blob/main/.github%2Fworkflows%2Fbuild_libs_and_unsigned_apk.yml>workflow</a> describe how to build libs and the apk



## Security
I recommend every user set a master password, it will used to encrypt password/passphrase of your credentials, you can set it on Settings screen. If you don't set master password, will use a public default password encrypt your credential, it is not enough safe cause it is public and actually no way hidden it.


## Help translate
### if your language added
1. find the `strings.xml` in the `res/values-your_language_code`
2. update it
3. send pr

### if your language not added
1. Download <a href="https://github.com/catpuppyapp/PuppyGit/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml">strings.xml</a>
2. Translate the file's values to your language, e.g.```<help>help translate</help>```to```<help>帮助翻译</help>```
3. Create an issue attaching the file you was translated, the issue should tell which language you translated to

Then I'll add your language into PuppyGit in further version, after added, if have new strings need translate, you can simple update existed `res/vlaues-your_language_code/strings.xml` in the PuppyGit project then send a pr to update it.

### The placeholder
I haven't use the default placeholder, because if it missed in the xml file, may cause app crashed, in my `strings.xml`, The strings like "ph_a3f241dc_NUMBER" are the placeholders, the last NUMBER is order, e.g. a string resource ```<str1>name: ph_a3f241dc_1, age: ph_a3f241dc_2</str1>```, will replaced when running, it maybe will show as: ```"name: abc, age: 123"```, if you have mistake with the order number, e.g.```<str1>name: ph_a3f241dc_2, age: ph_a3f241dc_1</str1>```, it may cause app show wrong text like ```"name: 123, age: abc"```

### I recommend
1. use "…" as ellipsis sign, rather than "...", because the former actually is shorter, only 1 char
2. don't delete the strings which need not translate, if you deleted, the origin english strings.xml will got a lot of err on the ide, so keep the english elements in your strings.xml even you don't need translate them.

### How I update existed languages
If I need add some simple words, I'll use AI translate to existed languages, if you found anything words wrong, you can fork my repo and update it, then send a pr.
If I need add some complex and long sentence, I'll create an issue and notice the translators, then the translators can fork my repo and update the strings.xml of their language, then send a pr to me.

#### Contributors username will display in the About screen of PuppyGit, if you don't want to your name presence in the list, you can send an email to me or create an issue to tell me. btw. you can find my email by click "Contact Author" in the About screen of PuppyGit



## Comments in code
this project has many chinese comments, and some comments are out-of-date or nonsense, I have no plan to clean them, but if you read the codes, and you wonder know some comments meaning, try translator or ask me is ok
